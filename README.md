# RSA-MFA-Environment (Supervised by RSA Engineers)
Implemented a full RSA MFA stack by integrating Identity Router ↔ Cloud Authentication Service, configuring AD/DNS/DHCP, and wiring up IAM, RADIUS, and SAML authentication flows across Windows Server and client systems. 🚀
Built and validated access policies, MFA workflows, and MyPage OTP protection, then executed high-load performance tests using JMeter to benchmark REST API and RADIUS request handling under stress. ⚡
